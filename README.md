# Project 1 - 777 Jackpot
A game project that includes a slot machine based around the 777 Jackpot but with numbers in a 3x3 grid, done roughly in a week. The game is essentially gambling on money where you place an amount to bet to which you assume it will hit a pattern. If it does not hit what you bet on then you lose money and it becomes an endless cycle of addiction to reach the state of a winner. Enjoy miserably aiming to win virtual money.
